Using MathJax in Github Pages Markdown
======================================

The files here demonstrate using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in Github Page Markdown.

The file [`plain-html-example.html`](plain-html-example.html) is a simple example of using MathJax in a plain HTML page.

We want to achieve near identical HTML but using Markdown for our content.

This turns out to be pretty easy - first we need to define a Jekyll layout that pulls in the MathJax Javascript.

This can be found in [`_layouts/mathjax.html`](_layouts/mathjax.html).

Then when we want to use MathJax in our Markdown we just need to specify this layout in the [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) for the page.

The file [`markdown-example.md`](markdown-example.md) is an example of this.

When we look at the resulting autogenerated HTML on Github pages - [`markdown-example.html`](https://george-hawkins.github.io/using-mathjax-in-markdown/markdown-example.html) we can see that the result is identical to our original handcoded HTML file [`plain-html-example.html`](plain-html-example.html).

So did we need to change anything in our MathJax expressions?

Yes - one thing - the opening and closing `\(` and `\)` for inline expressions needed to be escaped with an addition backslash, so we ended up with `\\(` and `\\)`. For non-inline expressions it doesn't seem to be possible to use `\[` and `\]` (with or without extra escaping) but using `$$` does work.

Finally and **important** remember you have to adjust [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) for every new repository where you use Jekyll and Github Pages.
